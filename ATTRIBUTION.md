## Original Inspiration

This project was inspired by and initially based on:

**statusline.rs** by Peter Steinberger (@steipete)
Source: https://gist.github.com/steipete/8396e512171d31e934f0013e5651691e

## Our Implementation

While this project began as modifications to Peter's original statusline.rs, it has evolved into a substantially different implementation with:

- Persistent cost tracking across sessions
- Daily/monthly/all-time cost aggregation
- Progress bar visualizations
- Burn rate calculations
- Theme support (dark/light)
- Git integration enhancements
- Atomic file operations for data persistence
- Memory-efficient caching
- Additional model support

## License Note

Our implementation is licensed under MIT. The original gist did not specify a license, so we've:
1. Rewritten most of the core logic
2. Added substantial new functionality
3. Properly attributed the original inspiration

## Thanks

Special thanks to Peter Steinberger for statusline.rs that inspired this project.
